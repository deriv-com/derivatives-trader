# Monorepo Cleanup & Trader Extraction Analysis

## Current Structure Analysis

Based on my examination of the repository, here's what I've found about the current monorepo structure:

### Package Organization

The monorepo consists of multiple packages with the following primary ones:

1. **trader** - Main trading application with features for contract trading, charts, and market analysis
2. **reports** - Reporting functionality for trade history, open positions, etc.
3. **components** - Reusable UI components shared across applications
4. **shared** - Common utilities, constants, and helpers
5. **stores** - Central state management using MobX
6. **api/api-v2** - API client libraries with v2 being the newer implementation
7. **translations** - Internationalization support

```

### Architectural Patterns

1. **Dual Implementation Architecture**: The trader package maintains both legacy (App) and next-generation (AppV2) implementations, with device-specific routing between them (mobile uses AppV2, desktop uses App).

2. **Provider-based State Management**: Uses a hierarchical approach with:

    - StoreProvider from @deriv/stores for core/global state
    - TraderStoreProvider/ReportsStoreProvider for package-specific state
    - Component-specific stores accessed via custom hooks (useTraderStore, useStore)

3. **Module Organization**:

    - trader: Trading, Contract, SmartChart modules
    - reports: Primarily containers for different report types

4. **Lazy Loading**: Uses React.lazy and dynamic imports for code splitting

### Dependency Structure

From examining package.json files across the monorepo:

#### trader dependencies:

- **Internal**:
    - @deriv/components: UI component library
    - @deriv/shared: Common utilities and helpers
    - @deriv/stores: State management
    - @deriv/translations: i18n support
    - @deriv/api: Backend communication
    - @deriv/utils: Utility functions
- **External UI**:
    - @deriv-com/ui: Design system components
    - @deriv-com/quill-ui: Additional UI components
    - @deriv-com/quill-icons: Icon library
    - @deriv-com/analytics: Analytics tracking
    - @deriv-com/derivatives-charts: Chart components
- **State Management**:
    - mobx: State management library
    - mobx-react-lite: React bindings for MobX
    - mobx-utils: Additional MobX utilities
- **UI Frameworks**:
    - react (v17.0.2): Core UI library
    - react-dom (v17.0.2): DOM rendering
    - classnames, clsx: CSS class management
    - framer-motion: Animation library
- **Data Handling**:
    - moment: Date manipulation

#### reports dependencies:

- **Internal**:
    - @deriv/components: UI component library
    - @deriv/shared: Common utilities and helpers
    - @deriv/stores: State management
    - @deriv/translations: i18n support
    - @deriv/api: Backend communication

    - crc-32: Checksum calculation
    - promise-polyfill: Promise compatibility
    - object.fromentries: Object.fromEntries polyfill
- **Forms**:
    - formik: Form management

### Coupling Points

Based on the examined files, several key coupling points exist:

1. **Store Dependencies**:

    - Both packages heavily depend on @deriv/stores for state management
    - Use of common StoreProvider from @deriv/stores
    - Access to global state via useStore hook

2. **Shared Components**:

    - Both packages rely on @deriv/components for UI elements
    - Common design patterns and styling approaches

3. **API Integration**:

    - Dependency on @deriv/api or @deriv-v2/api for backend communication
    - Shared API request formats and response handling

4. **Feature Flags**:

    - App vs AppV2 routing logic is coupled with feature flags
    - Device detection for routing decisions

5. **Providers Pattern**:
    - Similar provider hierarchies for state injection
    - TraderStoreProvider/ReportsStoreProvider wrapping StoreProvider

## Redundancies and Inefficiencies

### Package-Level Redundancies

1. **Dual App Implementations**:

    - Maintaining both App and AppV2 versions increases complexity
    - Significant code duplication between implementations
    - Conditional routing logic adds overhead

2. **Overlapping Utilities**:

    - Utility functions duplicated or similar across packages
    - Format helpers, validation functions, and transformers appear in multiple places

3. **Dependency Duplication**:
    - Many dependencies listed in multiple package.json files
    - Testing libraries duplicated across packages
    - React ecosystem libraries duplicated with varying versions

### Library Redundancies

1. **Date Handling**:

    - Using both moment (trader, reports) and dayjs (shared) across different packages
    - Inconsistent date format patterns

2. **Multiple UI Libraries**:

    - @deriv-com/ui alongside @deriv/components
    - Multiple icon libraries (@deriv/quill-icons)
    - Potential design inconsistencies

3. **Lodash Components**:
    - Individual lodash utilities imported (lodash.debounce, lodash.throttle) rather than using modular imports
    - Potential for duplicate functionality

### Potential Dead Code

1. **Legacy App Implementation**:

    - As AppV2 becomes more mature, App becomes increasingly redundant
    - Device-specific routing suggests mobile is already using AppV2

2. **Page404 Module**:

    - Duplicated in both trader and reports packages
    - Error handling should be consolidated

3. **Commented-out Code**:

    - Found traces of commented-out code, such as line 11 in useTraderStores.tsx
    - Indicates abandoned implementation attempts

4. **Multiple Testing Approaches**:
    - Testing directories with potentially outdated tests
    - Mixture of testing libraries and patterns

### Technical Debt

1. **Version Management**:

    - Multiple versions of the same libraries across packages
    - Potential for version conflicts or unexpected behavior

2. **Tight Coupling to Stores**:

    - Components directly depend on specific store structures
    - Makes extraction and standalone usage difficult

3. **Complex Provider Hierarchy**:

    - Nested providers create dependency chains
    - Initialization order becomes critical

4. **Feature Flag Complexity**:
    - Conditional rendering based on flags increases code complexity
    - Multiple paths through the application increase testing burden

## Cleanup Strategy

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following cleanup strategy to isolate what's required for a trading-only repository:

```yaml
monorepo_cleanup:
    package_audit:
        trader:
            unused_files:
                - App/* (if AppV2 is now the primary implementation)
                - Modules/Page404/* (can be consolidated)
                - __tests__/* (review for relevance)
            overly_coupled_files:
                - trader-providers.tsx: depends on @deriv/stores
                - Stores/useTraderStores.tsx: tight coupling with modules.trade
                - index.tsx: device detection routing logic
        reports:
            unused_files:
                - Modules/Page404/* (duplicated with trader)
                - Components/__tests__/* (if tests are not maintained)
    redundant_dependencies:
        - moment (can be replaced with dayjs across all packages)
        - lodash.throttle, lodash.debounce (use lodash with modular imports)
        - Multiple React Router versions (standardize on latest compatible)
        - Duplicated testing libraries across packages
        - Overlapping UI libraries (@deriv-com/ui vs @deriv/components)
    files_to_extract:
        - from: shared/constants
          to: trader/constants
          reason: isolate trader-specific constants
        - from: stores/Modules/Trading
          to: trader/Stores/Modules/Trading
          reason: reduce coupling with global stores
        - from: components/relevant-components
          to: trader/Components
          reason: include only components needed by trader
        - from: api-v2/src/ws-client
          to: trader/api/ws-client
          reason: include only required API client code
    standalone_plan:
        retain:
            - trader (focusing on AppV2)
            - Essential components from @deriv/components:
                  - Form inputs
                  - Buttons
                  - Modals
                  - Dropdown/Select
                  - Loading indicators
            - Critical utilities from @deriv/shared:
                  - Format helpers
                  - Validation functions
                  - Constants
            - Trading-specific stores
            - API client (api-v2)
        remove:
            - reports package
            - Legacy App implementation
            - Unused component dependencies
            - Device-specific routing logic
        replace:
            - Global StoreProvider with scoped TraderStoreProvider
            - External dependencies with direct imports
            - moment with dayjs
            - Individual lodash utilities with modular imports
    refactoring_notes:
        - Extract MobX stores into internal store folder with scoped usage
        - Replace cross-package hooks with internal implementations
        - Remove feature flags that control App vs AppV2 switching
        - Consolidate duplicate utility functions
        - Implement a simplified provider hierarchy
        - Update import paths to reflect new structure
```

## Migration Plan

To transform the trader package into a standalone project:

### 1. Project Setup and File Organization

- **Create New Repository Structure**:

    ```
    trader-standalone/
    ├── src/                  # Main source code
    │   ├── api/              # API client from @deriv/api-v2
    │   ├── components/       # UI components from @deriv/components

        const { isMobile } = useDevice();
        return isMobile ? <AppV2Loader passthrough={passthrough} /> : <AppLoader passthrough={passthrough} />;
    };

    // After (simplified)

    - Create usage examples

## Review Notes (Iteration 1)

The initial analysis provides a solid foundation but requires further refinement in several areas:

1. **Component Analysis**: Need more detailed examination of which specific components from @deriv/components are essential for trader functionality.

2. **Store Dependencies**: Further analysis of the specific stores needed and their interdependencies would strengthen the migration plan.

3. **Build System**: More detailed examination of the webpack configuration would help ensure a smooth transition to standalone build.

4. **Import Path Updates**: A more comprehensive strategy for updating import paths throughout the codebase is needed.

5. **Testing Strategy**: The testing approach needs more detail, particularly around mocking dependencies that were previously provided by the monorepo.

## Review Notes (Iteration 2)

### Essential Component Analysis

After careful examination, the following specific components from @deriv/components are essential for the trader package:

1. **Form Components**:

    - Input
    - Checkbox
    - RadioGroup
    - DatePicker
    - DropdownList
    - MultiDropdown
    - AmountInput
    - CurrencyBadge
    - ValidationErrors

2. **Layout Components**:

    - Accordion
    - Tabs
    - Card
    - Collapsible
    - Drawer
    - Modal
    - Popover
    - FadeWrapper
    - AutoHeightWrapper
    - DesktopWrapper

3. **Feedback Components**:

    - Loading
    - ProgressBar
    - CircularProgress
    - Notification
    - ErrorModal
    - EmptyState

4. **Data Display Components**:

    - DataTable
    - DataList
    - ContractCard
    - Badge
    - Clipboard
    - Counter
    - ArrowIndicator

5. **Navigation Components**:
    - ButtonToggle
    - Button
    - ButtonLink
    - Calendar
    - FilterDropdown

These components represent the core UI building blocks needed for the trading interface, contract details, and chart functionality. The list was compiled by analyzing the component imports across the trader package modules.

### Store Dependencies Analysis

The trader package relies on the following stores with their specific responsibilities:

1. **Core Stores** (from @deriv/stores):

    - **ClientStore**: Manages user account information, balances, and authentication state
    - **UIStore**: Controls UI state like theme, drawer visibility, and notifications
    - **CommonStore**: Handles app-wide settings, network status, and feature flags
    - **PortfolioStore**: Manages active contracts and positions

2. **Trader-Specific Stores**:

    - **TradeStore**: Core trading functionality including trade parameters, form state, and trade execution
    - **ContractStore**: Contract details and management for active positions
    - **ChartStore**: Configuration and state for the SmartChart component

3. **Store Interdependencies**:
    ```
    ClientStore ← TradeStore (needs account information for trading)
    UIStore ← TradeStore (for notifications and modal control)
    PortfolioStore ← ContractStore (for position management)
    TradeStore ← ContractStore (for contract creation from trades)
    ChartStore ← TradeStore (for chart synchronization with trade parameters)
    ```

To reduce coupling, the standalone implementation should:

1. Extract the essential functionality from each core store
2. Implement a streamlined version that only includes trader-specific functionality
3. Use a more explicit dependency injection approach rather than global store access

### Webpack Configuration Analysis

The current webpack configuration has several monorepo-specific elements that need adjustment:

1. **Aliases**:

    ```javascript
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        Components: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src', 'Components'),
        App: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src', 'App'),
        Modules: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src', 'Modules'),
        Constants: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src', 'Constants'),
        ...generateWebpackConfig.aliases,
      }
    }
    ```

    These include cross-package references that must be updated to local paths.

2. **External Dependencies**:

    ```javascript
    externals: [
        {
            '@deriv/shared': '@deriv/shared',
            '@deriv/components': '@deriv/components',
            '@deriv/translations': '@deriv/translations',
        },
        ...generateWebpackConfig.externals,
    ];
    ```

    These prevent bundling of shared packages, which won't be needed in standalone mode.

3. **Entry Points**:
    ```javascript
    entry: {
      trader: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src', 'index.tsx'),
      ...generateWebpackConfig.entry,
    }
    ```
    Will need simplification to focus only on the trader application.

For the standalone build, the webpack configuration should:

1. Remove externals for @deriv packages
2. Update aliases to reference local paths
3. Simplify entry points to focus on the main application
4. Add bundling for previously external dependencies
5. Optimize chunk splitting for the standalone application structure

### Import Path Update Strategy

To handle the transition from monorepo imports to local imports, a systematic approach is needed:

1. **Mapping External to Internal Imports**:

    ```javascript
    // Before
    import { Button } from '@deriv/components';
    import { useStore } from '@deriv/stores';
    import { formatMoney } from '@deriv/shared';

    // After
    import { Button } from 'components/button';
    import { useStore } from 'stores/use-store';
    import { formatMoney } from 'utils/format';
    ```

2. **Import Update Process**:

    - Create a comprehensive mapping of all import paths
    - Use a codemod script to automate the transformation
    - Implement a multi-phase approach to verify each package's imports separately
    - Add TypeScript path aliases to maintain consistent imports

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:

    - Dynamic imports need special handling to update their paths
    - Type imports may need adjustments for local type definitions
    - Lazy-loaded components require updates to their import paths

4. **Testing Import Updates**:
    - Implement TypeScript checking to catch path errors
    - Create unit tests to verify components load correctly
    - Use end-to-end tests to validate complete application paths

This approach ensures a methodical transition that preserves functionality while moving to a more cohesive structure.

### Testing Strategy

The standalone project requires a comprehensive testing approach to replace the monorepo testing infrastructure:

1. **Unit Testing Framework**:

    - Configure Jest with TypeScript support
    - Set up test utilities for component rendering
    - Implement mock factories for API responses and store states

2. **Mocking Strategies**:

    - **API Mocking**: Create mock implementations of the API client

        ```javascript
        // Example API mock
        const mockAPIClient = {
            send: jest.fn().mockImplementation(request => {
                if (request.name === 'proposal') {
                    return Promise.resolve({ data: mockProposalResponse });
                }
                return Promise.resolve({ data: {} });
            }),
            subscribe: jest.fn(),
            unsubscribe: jest.fn(),
        };
        ```

    - **Store Mocking**: Implement mock stores for testing components

        ```javascript
        // Example store mock
        const mockTradeStore = {
            purchase_info: { buy_price: 100 },
            proposal_info: { id: 'mock', askPrice: 100 },
            trade_types: mockTradeTypes,
            onChange: jest.fn(),
            onPurchase: jest.fn(),
        };
        ```

    - **Router Mocking**: Set up mocks for react-router context
        ```javascript
        const renderWithRouter = (
            ui,
            { route = '/', history = createMemoryHistory({ initialEntries: [route] }) } = {}
        ) => {
            return {
                ...render(<Router history={history}>{ui}</Router>),
                history,
            };
        };
        ```

3. **Integration Testing**:

    - Implement component integration tests that verify interaction between components
    - Create tests for store interactions to validate data flow
    - Test form submissions and validation logic

4. **End-to-End Testing**:

    - Set up Cypress for end-to-end testing
    - Create test scenarios for critical user flows:
        - Market selection
        - Trade parameter configuration
        - Trade execution
        - Contract management
    - Test responsive behaviors across different viewport sizes

5. **Test Data Management**:
    - Create fixtures for common test data
    - Implement factory functions to generate test data
    - Maintain test coverage for edge cases and error states

This testing strategy ensures that the standalone application maintains the same level of quality and reliability as the original monorepo implementation, while providing a more focused and efficient testing approach.

                          |                                |
                          |                                |
                  +-------+--------+              +--------+-------+
                  |                |              |                |
                  |  TradeStore    |<----------->|  ContractStore |
                  |                |              |                |
                  +-------+--------+              +--------+-------+
                          |                                |
                          |                                |
                          v                                v
                  +----------------+              +----------------+
                  |                |              |                |
                  | Trading Module |              | Contract Module|
                  |                |              |                |
                  +-------+--------+              +----------------+
                          |
                          |
                          v

                          |
                          |
              +-----------+-----------+
              |           |           |
              v           v           v
      +----------------+  |  +----------------+
      |                |  |  |                |
      | Trading Module |  |  | Contract Module|
      |                |  |  |                |
      +----------------+  |  +----------------+
                          |
                          v
                  +----------------+
                  |                |
                  |  SmartChart    |
                  |                |
                  +----------------+
```

This simplified structure reduces coupling and makes the application easier to maintain and extend.
